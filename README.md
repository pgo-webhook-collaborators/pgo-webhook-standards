# PGo Community Webhook Standards
The goal of this project is to provide a standard webhook definition that can
 be collaboratively defined and implemented between different projects. This
 standard will allow for consistent communication between different
 applications, allowing users to combine applications where needed.

## Current Collaborators
* [PokeAlarm Team](https://github.com/PokeAlarm)
* [RealDeviceMap Team](https://github.com/RealDeviceMap)
* [Map-A-Droid Team](https://github.com/map-a-droid)
* [PoracleJs](https://github.com/KartulUdus/PoracleJS)


## Who decides on the standards?
Modifications will be presented as PRs, and current collaborators will be asked
 for feedback. In the event of a dispute, decisions will be made in support from
 the majority of collaborators.

## How can I become a collaborator?
If you are an owner in a project that wishes to have a say in the community
 standards, all you need to do is open a PR to add yourself (or your team) in
 two places:

 1. Add you or your team's github tag to the `CODEOWNERS` file. This will
 automatically request your review when new PRs are opened.
 2. Add you or your team's name and a link to the project in the `README.md`
 (this file). This makes it easy to users to see you are involved and find your
 project.

 All teams engaged in active, reasonably popular projects are welcome to join -
 the only requirement is to make sure your project supports the standards and
 remain cooperative and respectful to the rest of the collaborators.
