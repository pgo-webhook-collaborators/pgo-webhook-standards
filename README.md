# PGo Community Webhook Standards
The goal of this project is to provide a standard webhook definition that can
 be collaboratively defined and implemented between different projects. This 
 standard will allow for consistent communication between different 
 applications, allowing users to combine applications where needed. 

## Current Collaborators
* [PokeAlarm Team](https://github.com/PokeAlarm)

## Who decides on the standards?  
Modifications will be presented as PRs, and current collaborators will be asked
 for feedback. In the event of a dispute, decisions will be made in support from 
 the majority of collaborators. 

## How can I become a collaborator? 
If you are a owner in a project that wishes to have a say in the community
 standards, all you need to do is open a PR to add yourself (or your team) in
 two places:
 
 1. Add you or your team's github tag to the `CODEOWNERS` file. This will 
 automatically request your review when new PRs are opened. 
 2. Add you or your team's name and a link to the project in the `README.md` 
 (this file). This makes it easy to users to see you are involved and find your
 project.
 
 All teams engaged in active, reasonably popular projects are welcome to join - 
 the only requirement is to make sure your project supports the standards and
 remain cooperative and respectful to the rest of the collaborators.
